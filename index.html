                Thought, the day you disappeared that it was over<br>
                Didn't even hear you leavin'<br>
                Saw you with someone and thought that it was closure<br>
                But you still tell me that you need me<br>
                <br>
                Baby, why?<br>
                Tell me why can't you just make up your mind?<br>
                Quit messin' with my head<br>
                <br>
                You can't say you hate me<br>
                Then call me when you're hurt<br>
                Baby, you know that's not how this works<br>
                No, that's not how this works
            </p>

            <p>
                You can't walk away<br>
                Then come back to what we were<br>
                Baby, you know that's not how this works<br>
                No, that's not how this works, no<br>
                Baby, that's not how this works, no
            </p>

                Baby, that's not how this works, no<br>
                That's not how this works, oh<br>
                <br>
                Stop reminding me of when we said forever<br>
                I know exactly what you're doing
